\section{Introduction}
\label{tree:sorting:intro}

Sorting data is a well-studied problem. Results in this domain are basic while extremely important because of the applications (principally data management).
There exist very simple algorithms that do the job efficiently hence it's a very smooth subject to begin with in algorithmics.
It's well suited for an introductory course in the domain as it exposes various algorithmic paradigms : recursion, divide-and-conquer, parallelism, randomization; as well as mathematical concepts : Big O notation, enumerating permutations.
