\begin{theorem}
The ITLB for the sorting problem is \BigOmega{log(n!)}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A sequence $s$ of length $n$ has $n!$ permutations. The decision tree has thus $n!$ leaves, hence the minimal height of the tree is $\log(n!)$.
\end{proof}

\nb{This means that, for any algorithm you may think of, there will always be at least an instance of the problem that will force your algorithm to ask \BigOmega{\log(n!)} questions to the oracle.}
