\section{Definition}
\label{tree:merging:def}

The problem is stated as the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The input is an unknown total order $\preceq$ and a set of totally ordered sets $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k\}$.
\item The output is a total order on $s' = \Cup_{i=1}^{n} s_i$ compatible with every $s_i$.
\item The unknown total order $\preceq$ can only be queried with questions of the form $a \stackrel{?}{\le} b, a \in s_i, b \in s_j, i \neq j$.
\end{enumerate}
