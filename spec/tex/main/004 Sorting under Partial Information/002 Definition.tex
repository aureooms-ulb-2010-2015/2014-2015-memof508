\section{Definition}

A second problem is the following,

Let $V = \left\{{v_1 , \cdots , v_n }\right\}$ be a set equipped with an unknown linear order. Given a subset of the relations $v_i \leq v_j$, determine the complete linear order by queries of the form: ``is $v_i \leq v_j$ ?''. (\cite{cardinal2013sorting})
