First appearance of the problem in \cite{fredman1976good} where an algorithm making $\BigO{\log e(P) + 2n}$ was featured. However this algorithm was not matching the ITLB for sub-linear $\log e(P)$. (\cite{cardinal2013sorting})

At that time, it remained open whether there existed, on the one hand, an algorithm performing $\BigO{\log e(P)}$ comparisons, and, on the other hand, an algorithm running in polynomial time. (\cite{cardinal2013sorting})

The first question was answered by \cite{kahn1984balancing}. They showed that there always exists a query of the form ``is $v_i \leq v_j$ ?'' such that the fraction of linear extensions in which $v_i$ is smaller than $v_j$ lies in the interval $(\sfrac{3}{11}, \sfrac{8}{11})$. This is a relaxation of the well-known $\sfrac{1}{3}$--$\sfrac{2}{3}$ conjecture, a conjecture formulated independently by Fredman, Linial, and Stanley, see \cite{linial1984information}. A simpler proof yielding weaker bounds was given by \cite{kahn1991balancing}. Better bounds were later given by \cite{brightwell1995balancing}, and \cite{brightwell1999balanced}. Iteratively choosing such a comparison yields an algorithm that performs $\BigO{\log e(P)}$ comparisons. However, finding the right comparisons in polynomial time remained intractable.
