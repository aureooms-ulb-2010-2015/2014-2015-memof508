\section{$\sfrac{1}{3}$--$\sfrac{2}{3}$ conjecture}

The $\sfrac{1}{3}$--$\sfrac{2}{3}$ conjecture states that in any finite partially ordered set P that is not totally ordered there exists a pair (x,y) of elements of P for which the linear extensions of P in which x < y number between 1/3 and 2/3 of the total number of linear extensions of P.[9][10] An equivalent way of stating the conjecture is that, if one chooses a linear extension of P uniformly at random, there is a pair (x,y) which has probability between 1/3 and 2/3 of being ordered as x < y.
