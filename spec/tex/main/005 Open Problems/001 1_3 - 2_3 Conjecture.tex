\section{$\sfrac{1}{3}$--$\sfrac{2}{3}$ Conjecture}

The $\sfrac{1}{3}$--$\sfrac{2}{3}$ conjecture states that in any finite partially ordered set $P$ that is not totally ordered there exists a pair $(x,y)$ of elements of $P$ for which the linear extensions of $P$ in which $x < y$ number between $\sfrac{1}{3}$ and $\sfrac{2}{3}$ of the total number of linear extensions of $P$. An equivalent way of stating the conjecture is that, if one chooses a linear extension of $P$ uniformly at random, there is a pair $(x,y)$ which has probability between $\sfrac{1}{3}$ and $\sfrac{2}{3}$ of being ordered as $x < y$.
