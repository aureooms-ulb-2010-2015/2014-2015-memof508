\section{\concept{ITLB}}
\label{tree:POP:itlb}

The key point of the reduction found in \cite{jcardin1} is to prove that the \concept{ITLB} of the resulting weak order $W$ is not much more than that of the original partial order $P$.

They proove that,

\begin{equation}
\text{H}(P) \leq \text{H}(W) \leq \text{H}(P) + 2 \log(\text{H}(P) + 1) + \BigO{1}.
\label{eq:jcardin1}
\end{equation}


And using \cite{kahnkim1},

\begin{equation}
\log\left(\frac{n!}{e(P)}\right) = \underbrace{\log(n!) - \log(e(P))}_\text{ITLB} = n \text{H}(P) + \BigO{n}
\label{eq:khankim1}
\end{equation}

The proof is done.
