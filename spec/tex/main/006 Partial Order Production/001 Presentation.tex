The problem is the following,

Find a bijective relation between a Hasse diagram and an set of elements.

The input is thus composed of a partial order in form of a Hasse diagram and a set $A$ of elements (see \ref{fig:pop:diag}).

\cite{jcardin1} solves the Partial Order Production problem in 2 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Produce a weak order $W$ from the partial order in O($n^3$);
\item Run a multiple selection algorithm on ($W$,$A$).
\end{enumerate}
