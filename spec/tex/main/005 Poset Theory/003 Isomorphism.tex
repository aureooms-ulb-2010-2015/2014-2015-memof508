\section{Isomorphism}

Two posets $P$ and $Q$ are \emph{isomorphic}, denoted $P \cong Q$, if there exists an \emph{order-preserving bijection} $\phi : P \to Q$ whose inverse is order-preserving; that is, $$s \leq t~\text{in}~P \iff \phi(s) \leq \phi(t)~\text{in}~Q.$$ For example, if $B_S$ denotes the poset of all subsets of the set $S$ ordered by inclusion, then $B_S \cong B_T$ whenever $\#S = \#T$. \cite{Stanley:2011:ECV:2124415}
