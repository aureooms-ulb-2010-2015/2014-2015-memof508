\section{Linear Extensions}

A Linear extension of a partial order $\leq$ is a total order $\leq^*$ compatible with the partial order. \emph{Linear} means that the order $\leq^*$ must be total while \emph{extension} means that the original order $\leq$ is ``preserved'' i.e. when $x \leq^* y \forall x, y s.t. x \leq y$
