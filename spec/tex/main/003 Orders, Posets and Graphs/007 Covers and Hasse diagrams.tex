\section{Covers and Hasse diagrams}
\label{tree:poset:hasse}

If $s, t \in P$, then we say that $t$ covers $s$ or $s$ is covered by $t$, denoted $s \lessdot t$ or $t \gtrdot s$, if $s < t$ and no element $u \in P$ satisfies $s < u < t$. Thus $t$ covers $s$ if and only if $s < t$ and $[s, t] = {s, t}$. A locally finite poset $P$ is completely determined by its cover relations. The Hasse diagram of a finite poset $P$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $P$, whose edges are the cover relations, and such that if $s < t$ then $t$ is drawn “above” $s$ (i.e., with a higher vertical coordinate). \ref{fig:stanley:3-1} shows the Hasse diagrams of all posets up to isomorphism) with at most four elements.

Some care must be taken in “recognizing” posets from their Hasse diagrams. For instance, the graph \includegraphics{fig/stanley/3-1:a} is a perfectly valid Hasse diagram, yet appears to be missing from \ref{fig:stanley:3-1}. This is because this graph is just another way of drawing one that is already present in \ref{fig:stanley:3-1}. This is what we mean by ```up to isomorphism'', i.e. that we only consider one version of isomorphic graphs.

Similarly, the graph \includegraphics{fig/stanley/3-1:b} doest not appear above. This is because we defined earlier that the edges of the Hasse diagram where the cover relations of the poset.


\ref{fig:stanley:3-2} illustrates the Hasse diagrams of some of the posets considered in \ref{ex:poset:def}. \cite{Stanley:2011:ECV:2124415}
