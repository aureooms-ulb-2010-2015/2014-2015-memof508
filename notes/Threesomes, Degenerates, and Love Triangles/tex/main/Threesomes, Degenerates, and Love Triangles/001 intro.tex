\section{Introduction to the subject}

The problem is the following,

\begin{problem}
The 3\textsc{sum} problem consists in finding three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, for
$a \in A, b \in B, c \in C$ and where $A, B, C \subset \mathbb{R}$, that sum
up to $0$, i.e. $a + b + c = 0$.
\end{problem}

In a recent paper (\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/JorgensenP14}) it is proved that
the 3\textsc{sum} conjecture does not hold true. As a reminder,

\begin{conjecture}
The 3\textsc{sum} conjecture states that the lower bound on the number of
comparisons in the decision tree model for the 3\textsc{sum} problem
is \BigOmega{n^2}.
\end{conjecture}

It was indeed proved that this lower bound holds for a particular case of the
decision tree model. By restricting himself to a $3$-linear decision tree model,
Jeff Erickson proves that 3\textsc{sum} is \BigOmega{n^2} in this particular
model.

Note that for $3\textsc{sum}$ we consider a $3$-linear decision model
since the function we evaluate at each step is linear and accepts 3 arguments.
Here the function is $f(a, b, c) = a + b + c$ and we make decisions depending on
the sign of the output of this function ( $<0, =0, >0$ ).

More generally, in \cite{cj99-08}, Jeff Erickson proves that in the $k$-linear
decision tree model, for any $k > 0$, the $k\textsc{sum}$ problem,
whose definition can be easily deduced from the $3\textsc{sum}$ problem
definition, is \BigOmega{n^{\sfrac{k}{2}}} for even $k$ and
\BigOmega{n^{\sfrac{(k+1)}{2}}} for odd $k$.

Although the 3\textsc{sum} problem has not a lot of practical applications, many
other problems are reducible from 3\textsc{sum} and thus a lower bound for
3\textsc{sum} would imply lower bounds for those other problems.

In April 2014, Pettie and Gr√∏nlund released a publication that showed that there
exists an algorithm making a subquadratic amount of evaluation of the function
$f(a, b, c, d)$.
