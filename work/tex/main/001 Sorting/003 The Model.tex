\section{The model}
\label{tree:sorting:model}

From here till the end we will use the \defineconcept{Decision Tree Model} : we can ask an Oracle questions that will be answered yes or no hence each question we ask to this oracle will at most give us one bit of information.

The worst minimum number of questions that one has to ask in order to sort a sequence $s \in S_n$ of length $n$ will be the \defineconcept{ITLB} of the sorting problem.
