\section{The model}
\label{tree:sorting:model}

From here till the end we will use the \defineconcept{Decision Tree Model} : we can ask an oracle questions that will be answered yes or no hence each question we ask to this oracle will at most give us one supplementary bit of information.

$S_n$ being the set of all sequences of length $n$, the worst minimum number of questions that one has to ask in order to sort a sequence $s \in S_n$ will be the \defineconcept{ITLB} of the sorting problem.
