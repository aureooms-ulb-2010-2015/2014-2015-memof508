\subsection{ITLB}
\label{tree:merging:k=2:ITLB}


\begin{theorem}
The ITLB for the merging problem when $k = 2$ with $|s_1| = n, |s_2| = m$ is \BigO{log \binom{n+m}{n}}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The length of the output sequence $s'$ is $n+m$. In order to zip $s_1$ and $s_2$ we have to choose the $n$ among $n+m$ positions in $s'$ for the elements of $s_1$ and then fill the remaining $(n+m) - n = m$ positions with the elements of $s_2$. The number of leaves of the decision tree is $\binom{n+m}{n}$ hence the worst minimal height of the tree is $log \binom{n+m}{n}$.
\end{proof}
