\subsection{ITLB}
\label{tree:merging:kgeq3:ITLB}


\begin{theorem}
The ITLB for the merging problem when $k \geq 3$ with $|s_i| = m_i$ and $m' = \sum_{i=1}^{k} m_i$ is \BigOmega{\log \frac{m'}{m_1 \cdot m_2 \dots m_k}}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The length of the output sequence $s'$ is $m'$. In order to zip all the $s_i$ we have to choose the $m_1$ among $m'$ positions in $s'$ for the elements of $s_1$ and then recursively call ourselves on the remaining $m'-m_1$ positions with the elements of $Q' = \{s_2, \dots, s_k\}$. The number of leaves of the decision tree is $\frac{m'}{m_1 \cdot m_2 \dots m_k}$ hence the worst minimal height of the tree is $\log \frac{m'}{m_1 \cdot m_2 \dots m_k}$.
\end{proof}

\nb{Giving $\log \frac{m'}{m_1 \cdot m_2 \dots m_k}$ in the form of the Stirling's approximation gives us $m' \log m' - \sum_{i=1}^{k} m_i \log m_i$ which clearly express the information contained in the sorted sequence $s'$ of $m'$ elements minus the information we already have.}
