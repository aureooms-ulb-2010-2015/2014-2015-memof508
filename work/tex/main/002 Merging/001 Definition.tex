\section{Definition}
\label{tree:merging:def}

The problem is stated as the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The input is a total order $O$ and a set $Q$ of sorted (according to $O$) sequences of elements ${s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k}, k \geq 2$
\item The output is a sequence of elements $s'$ which
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item is a zipping\footnote{interleaving} of the $s_i \in Q$
	\item is in nondecreasing order according to $O$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
