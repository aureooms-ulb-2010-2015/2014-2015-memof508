This work exposes lower bounds and algorithms for problems
in the Decision Tree Model. All the problems we consider are in some way
related to the classical Sorting problem. We start with the classical
Sorting and Merging problems. Then we explain the more generic problems
of Sorting under Partial Information and Merging under Partial Information.
The last part of this work concerns problems from which \threeSUM, \kSUM,
\kLDT, Sorting \XY, and Point Location in an Arrangement of Hyperplanes.
