This work exposes lower bounds and algorithms for problems in the Linear
Decision Tree Model. All the problems we consider are in some way related to
Sorting. We start with Sorting and Merging. Then we explain the more general
problems of Sorting under Partial Information and Merging under Partial
Information. The last part of this work concerns \threeSUM, \kSUM, \kLDT,
Sorting \XY, and Point Location in an Arrangement of Hyperplanes.
