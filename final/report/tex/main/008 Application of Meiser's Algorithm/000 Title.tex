\chapter{Application of Meiser's Algorithm}

As we have seen in \ref{tree:xy:counting}, it is possible to argue about an
upper bound on the number of possible linear extensions of the poset \XY by
regarding the problem of sorting \XY as a point location problem in an
arrangement of hyperplanes. We will now formally generalize this observation
to the \kSUM problem. Since we saw earlier in \ref{tree:related:xy4ldt} that
sorting \XY is a special case of \fourSUM, this generalization feels natural.
