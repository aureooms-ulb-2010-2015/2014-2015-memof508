\section{Reduction to a Point Location Problem}

We now describe a problem which can be used to model
various kind of set sum problems, including subset sum, \kSUM and \kLDT.

The problem is to locate a point \(x\) in the \(n\)-dimensional space \(\R^n\) relatively
to an arrangement of hyperplanes \(\A(\H)\). This arrangement divides the space
in cells of dimension \(0,\ldots,n-1\) and the goal will be to determine which
cell contains point \(x\). This amounts to determining for each
hyperplane \(H_i\) whether the point \(x\) lies above, on or below \(H_i\).

Formally, we define the point location problem in an arrangement of hyperplanes as
follows,

\begin{problem}
Given a point $x \in \R^n$ and an arrangement of hyperplanes $\H = \enum{ H_i
\st 1 \leq i \leq m }$ determine the position vector of $x$, $\pv(x) \in
\signset^n$ where $\pv_i(x) = \sigma, \sigma \in \signset$ iff $x \in
H_i^{\sigma}$. We define $H_i^{0}$, $H_i^{-}$ and $H_i^{+}$ to be
respectively $H_i$ itself, the half-space below $H_i$ and the half-space above
$H_i$.
\end{problem}

In the \kSUM problem, we are trying to find all subsets \(\S_i\) of the universe
\(\U = \enum{u_1,\ldots,u_n}\) satisfying the following constraints: \(\U\) is a finite subset of \(\R\) of
cardinality \(n\), every subset $\S_i$ of $\U$ must contain exactly
$k$ elements of $\U$ and the sum of those $k$ elements must be equal to $0$.
For a specific set $\S$ we name those elements $s_1, \dots, s_k$.

We now describe a procedure to convert any instance of the \kSUM problem to an
instance of the point location problem in an arrangement of hyperplanes.

Let us note the bijection between $n$-tuples $(u_1, \ldots, u_n)$ and points in
$\R^n$. By agreeing on an order of the elements of $\U$ (e.g. the total order on
the real numbers) we can associate a unique $n$-tuple to each universe set $\U$,
and thus a unique point $x$ in $\R^n$ for each $\U$.

For each $\S_i = \left\{s_1, \dots, s_k\right\}$ we need to find whether the sum $s_1
+ \dots + s_k$ is equal to zero. In our new representation of the problem this
boils down to finding whether our point $x$ lies on the hyperplane of
equation $x_{i_1} + \dots + x_{i_k} = 0$. We thus draw every such hyperplane,
there are less than $n^k$ of them, and to solve the problem
we will have to find on which of them the point $x$ lies.

We just showed how to reduce \kSUM, in the sense of Turing reduction, to a
point location problem in an arrangement of hyperplanes. In the next section,
we will detail an algorithm due to \citet*{meiser:1993} that can be used to
solve \kSUM efficiently for any $k$.  There exists several methods to solve
this problem. We will describe Meiser's Algorithm~\cite{meiser:1993} since it
is the first algorithm that solves this point location problem in time
polynomial in both $n$ and $\log m$, for fixed $\H$ and $n$. This particular
algorithm will give us the opportunity to prove that the decision tree complexity
of subset sum is polynomial.
