\chapter{Introduction}

Dear reader,

This work focuses on problems related to sorting. We first give a rehearsal on
well-studied problems: sorting and merging. The goal of this rehearsal will be
to clearly define what we mean when we say sorting or merging. This will also
give us the occasion to introduce tools that will be needed all along this
document. Two examples of such tools are Stirling's approximation and the
mergesort algorithm.

The third chapter will be dedicated to formalization of commonly used objects
in order theory. There, we will familiarize ourselves with partially ordered
sets, their structure and the concept of entropy when applied to them.
