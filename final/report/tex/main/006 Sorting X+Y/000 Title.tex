\chapter{Sorting \XY}

Now we describe three approaches that can be used to solve the problem
of sorting \XY. For the sake of simplicity, and without loss of generality,
we restrict ourselves to the case where $\card{\X} = \card{\Y} = n$.

The ideas behind \Cref{tree:xy:merge}, \Cref{tree:xy:grid} and
\Cref{tree:xy:counting} can be found in \citet*{harper:1975}.
