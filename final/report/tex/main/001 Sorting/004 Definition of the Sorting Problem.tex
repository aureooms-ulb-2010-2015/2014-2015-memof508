\section{Definition of the Sorting Problem}
\label{tree:sorting:def}

We give the definition of the sorting problem as a specification for algorithms
solving this problem.
If we were writing an algorithm to solve the sorting problem, the input and output
conditions could be described as follows:
\begin{problem}[Sorting]\mbox{}
\begin{algorithm}
\item[input] An unknown total order \(\le\) and a set of elements \(\S\).
\item[output] The total order \(\le\) on \(\S\).
\end{algorithm}
\end{problem}

The unknown total order \(\le\) is the oracle in our model. To solve our
problem, we have to retrieve the complete information concealed by this
unknown total order on \(\S\). This is done by asking questions of the
form \(s_i \ask{\le} s_j\) to the oracle, where \(s_i\) and \(s_j\) are
elements of the set \(\S\).
