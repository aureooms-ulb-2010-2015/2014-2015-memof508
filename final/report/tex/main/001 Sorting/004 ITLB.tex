\section{ITLB}
\label{tree:sorting:ITLB}

\begin{theorem}
The ITLB for the sorting problem is \BigOmega{\log(n!)}\footnote{Throughout
this document, $\log x$ denotes the binary logarithm of $x$.}. This means that,
for any algorithm you may think of, there will always be at least an instance
of the problem that will force your algorithm to ask \BigOmega{\log(n!)}
questions to the oracle.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A sequence $s$ of length $n$ has $n!$ permutations. The decision tree has thus
$n!$ leaves, hence the minimal height of the tree is $\log(n!)$.
\end{proof}

\nb{We call this lower bound the information theoretic lower bound (ITLB)
because it is the logarithm of the number of feasible solutions.}
