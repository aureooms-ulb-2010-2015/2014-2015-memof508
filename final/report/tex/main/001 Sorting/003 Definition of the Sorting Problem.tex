\section{Definition of the Sorting Problem}
\label{tree:sorting:def}

The sorting problem can be stated as the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The input is an unknown total order $\le$ and a set of elements $\S$;
\item The output is the total order $\le$ on $\S$.
\end{enumerate}

The unknown total order is the oracle in our model. By asking questions of the
form `is $s_i \le s_j$', where $s_i$ and $s_j$ are elements of the set $\S$,
we will retrieve enough information from the oracle to acquire the complete
information concealed by this unknown total order on $\S$.
