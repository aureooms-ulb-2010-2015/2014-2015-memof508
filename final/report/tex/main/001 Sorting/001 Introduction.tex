\label{tree:sorting:intro}

Sorting data is a well-studied problem. Results in this domain are basic while
extremely important because of the applications (principally data management).

There exist relatively simple algorithms that do the job efficiently. Hence, it
is a very smooth subject to begin with in algorithmics. Moreover, it is well
suited for an introductory course in the domain as it exposes various
algorithmic paradigms: recursion, divide-and-conquer, parallelism,
randomization; as well as mathematical concepts: enumerating permutations,
orders, decision trees.
