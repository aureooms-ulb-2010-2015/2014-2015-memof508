We will now define a series of problems and then make the link between those
problems, sorting and sorting $X + Y$.

The subset sum problem is the following

\begin{problem}
Given a set $S \subset \R$, $\left\vert{S}\right\vert = n$, find all
$S' \subseteq S$, such that $\sum\limits_{s \in S'} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The $k$-SUM problem is the following

\begin{problem}
Given a set $S \subset \R$, $\left\vert{S}\right\vert = n$, find all
$S' \subseteq S$, $\left\vert{S'}\right\vert = k$, such that $\sum\limits_{s
\in S'} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The $k$-LDT problem is the following

\begin{problem}
Given a set $S \subset \R$, $\left\vert{S}\right\vert = n$, and $k$
coefficients $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$, find all $k$-tuples
$S' = (s_1, \dots, s_k)$, $s_i \in S$, such that
$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i s_i = 0$.
\end{problem}
