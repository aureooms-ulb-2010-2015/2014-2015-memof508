\section{Linear Extensions and Entropy}

A linear extension of a partial order $\leq$ is a total order $\leq^*$
compatible with $\leq$. \emph{Linear} means that the order $\leq^*$ must be
total while \emph{extension} means that the original order $\leq$ is
``preserved'' \ie when \(x \leq^* y\) for all pair \((x,y)\) such that \(x
\leq y\).

In our decision tree model, the number of linear extensions $e(\P)$ of a poset
$\P$ is strongly related to the information contained in this poset. Since the
total information is $\log(n!)$, the information we miss is $\log(e(\P))$, then
the information we have is $\log(n!) - \log(e(\P))$.


Note that computing $e(\P)$ in the general case is \#P-complete
(see \citet*{brightwell1991counting}). Fortunately, \citet*{kahn:1995} give a good
approximation of $e(\P)$ using the definition of entropy of a graph we
introduced earlier,

\begin{equation}
\log\left(\frac{n!}{e(\P)}\right) = \log(n!) - \log(e(\P)) = n H(\P) +
\BigO{n}.
\label{eq:khankim1}
\end{equation}
