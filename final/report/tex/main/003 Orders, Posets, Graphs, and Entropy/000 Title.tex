\chapter{Orders, Posets, Graphs, and Entropy}

In the two previous chapters, we discussed orders and ordered sets without
defining them. Now that we have some background on the subjects of
sorting and merging it is a good time to formalize the objects we are using.

That is why we introduce new terminology that allows
us to identify the objects we manipulate and describe the algorithms we present
in a precise and rigorous way.

Note that most definitions can be found in \citet*{Stanley:2011:ECV:2124415}.
