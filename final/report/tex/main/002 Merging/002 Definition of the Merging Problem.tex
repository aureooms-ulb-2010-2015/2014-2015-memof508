\section{Definition of the Merging Problem}
\label{tree:merging:def}

We give the definition of the merging problem as a specification for algorithms
solving this problem.
An algorithm solving the merging problem must ensure the following conditions
regarding its input and output
\begin{problem}[Merging]\mbox{}
\begin{steps}
\item[input] An unknown total order \(\le\) and a set of totally ordered
sets \(\S = \enum{\S_1, \S_2, \ldots, \S_k}\).
\item[output] A total order on \(\S' = \cup_{i=1}^{k} \S_i\) compatible with
the total orders on the \(\S_i\).
\end{steps}
\end{problem}
Note that there is no restriction in what order we are allowed to compare
elements from \(\S_i\) and \(\S_j\).
