\section{Definition of the Merging Problem}
\label{tree:merging:def}

Similarily to the sorting problem, we can imagine that we have an algorithm
solving the merging problem. Such an algorithm would have the following
specification regarding its input and output:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The input is an unknown total order \(\le\) and a set of totally ordered
sets \(\S = \enum{\S_1, \S_2, \ldots, \S_k}\);
\item The output is a total order on \(\S' = \cup_{i=1}^{k} \S_i\) compatible with
the total orders on the \(\S_i\);
\item The unknown total order \(\le\) can only be queried with questions of the
form \(a \ask{\le} b, a \in \S_i, b \in \S_j, i \neq j\).
\end{enumerate}

Note that there is no restriction in what order we are allowed to compare
elements from \(\S_i\) and \(\S_j\).
