\section{Definition}
\label{tree:merging:def}

The problem is stated as the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The input is an unknown total order $\le$ and a set of totally ordered
sets ${\cal S} = \enum{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k}$.
\item The output is a total order on $S' = \cup_{i=1}^{n} S_i$ compatible with
the total orders on the $S_i$.
\item The unknown total order $\le$ can only be queried with questions of the
form $a \ask{\le} b, a \in S_i, b \in S_j, i \neq j$.
\end{enumerate}
