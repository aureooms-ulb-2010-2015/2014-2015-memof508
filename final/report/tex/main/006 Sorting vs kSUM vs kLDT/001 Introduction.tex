We will now define a series of problems and then make the link between those
problems, sorting and sorting \XY.

The subset sum problem is the following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, find all
$\S \subseteq \U$, such that $\sum\limits_{s \in \S} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The \kSUM problem is the following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, find all
$\S \subseteq \U$, $\card{\S} = k$, such that $\sum\limits_{s
\in \S} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The $k$-variate linear degeneracy testing problem, abbreviated \kLDT, is the
following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, and $k+1$ real
coefficients $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k \in \R$, find all $k$-tuples
$S = (s_1, \ldots, s_k)$, $s_i \in \U$, such that
$\alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i s_i = 0$.
\end{problem}
