\section{Three Set Sum Problems}

The three problems given in this section are about finding subsets whose
elements sum up to a certain constant. The first one is the subset sum problem
which is NP-complete~\cite{karp:1972}. The two others, \kSUM and \kLDT, are
variants of the first one where we fix the size $k$ of the subsets to search
for. \kLDT is different from \kSUM as it does not really compute a sum in the
strict sense.  It computes the image of a $k$-variate linear function
$\phi(s_1, \ldots, s_k) = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i s_i$, allowing
other values than $0$ or $1$ for the coefficients $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots,
\alpha_k$. It is trivial to see that \kSUM is contained in \kLDT. We will
explain in the next sections how these set sum problems relate to sorting
problems. Below are the formal definitions of the problem.

The subset sum problem is the following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, find all
$\S \subseteq \U$, such that $\sum\limits_{s \in \S} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The \kSUM problem is the following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, find all
$\S \subseteq \U$, $\card{\S} = k$, such that $\sum\limits_{s
\in \S} s = 0$.
\end{problem}


The $k$-variate linear degeneracy testing problem, abbreviated \kLDT, is the
following,

\begin{problem}
Given a set $\U \subset \R$, $\card{\U} = n$, and $k+1$ real
coefficients $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k \in \R$, find all $k$-tuples
$\S = (s_1, \ldots, s_k)$, $s_i \in \U$, such that
$\alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i s_i = 0$.
\end{problem}
