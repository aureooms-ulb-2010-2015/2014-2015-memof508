\section{Only Looking at the Grid Structure}

In the \XY problem, we are asked to find a linear extension of a known partial
order having a specific structure. The \XY problem is thus a specific case of
Sorting under Partial Information. In \ref{tree:supi}, we have seen that there
are algorithms solving the SUPI problem in \BigO{\log e(P)} comparisons. We
wonder if it is possible to prove that, if we are only allowed to exploit the
grid structure of a \XY poset, then \XY cannot be solved in less than \BigO{n^2
\log n} comparisons.
