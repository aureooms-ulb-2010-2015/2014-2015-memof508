\section{Using Decision Trees}
\label{tree:xy:dt}

In this section we will sketch a proof stating that there is an upperbound of \BigO{n^{8n}}
on the number of linear extensions of the poset $X + Y$. We will also
illustrate an algorithm due to \citet*{fredman:1976} that solves sorting problems
making at most $\log\card{\Gamma} + 2N$ queries, where $\Gamma$ is the set of
possible linear extensions of the input. This implies, that there exists an
algorithm making \BigO{n^2} queries for sorting $X + Y$.

\begin{theorem}[Fredman 1976 \cite{fredman:1976}]\label{theorem:fredman:1976}
A poset of cardinality $N$, whose linear extension is known to be contained in
$\Gamma$ can be sorted with $\log \card{\Gamma} + 2N$ pairwise comparisons.
\end{theorem}
