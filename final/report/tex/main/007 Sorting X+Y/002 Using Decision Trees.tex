\section{Using Decision Trees}
\label{tree:xy:dt}

In this section we will sketch a proof stating that there is an upperbound of \BigO{n^{8n}}
on the number of linear extensions of the poset $X + Y$. We will also
illustrate an algorithm due to Fredman (1976) that solves sorting problems
making at most $\log\card{\Gamma} + 2n$ queries, where $\Gamma$ is the set of
possible linear extensions. This implies, that there exists an
algorithm making \BigO{n^2} queries for sorting $X + Y$.
