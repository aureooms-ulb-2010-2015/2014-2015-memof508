\section{A Powerful Computing Model}

Now that we have shown how to reduce $k$-SUM to a point location in an
arrangement of hyperplanes problem, we will see that with a sufficiently
powerful computing model it is possible to solve the subset sum problem in
polynomial time.

Since the beginning of this writing, we were only interested by the number of
questions we ask to an oracle, and we will continue to take the same point of
view here. We wonder how many times we need to effectively ask an oracle
whether a point lies above, on or under a certain hyperplane.

The algorithm we will describe determines the position vector $\pv(x) \in
\signset^{\binom{n}{k}} $ of input vertex $x = {x_1, \dots, x_n}$, effectively
solving the $k$-SUM problem using \BigO{n^3} $n$-variate linear queries.

For fixed $k$ we draw all hyperplanes having equation involving exactly $k$
coordinates of $\R^n$ with coefficient $1$, we have thus $\card{\H} =
\binom{n}{k}$. We can do this without involving the input vertex at all, this
costs us $0$ queries.

We give each hyperplane an orientation such that when point $x$ is below
hyperplane $H_i$, it is in the lower half-space defined by $H_i$ denoted
$\Him$. When point $x$ is above hyperplane $H_i$ it is in the upper
half-space defined by $H_i$ denoted $\Hip$. We define $\Hiz$ to be the
hyperplane $H_i$ itself. The $i^{th}$ component of the position vector is
$\pv(x)_i = \sigma$ if and only if $x \in \His$.

Our first idea to determine the components of $\pv(x)$ is to iteratively
select a random subset of size \BigO{\poly(n)} constitued of hyperplanes of the
arrangement $\Ht$ for which the relative position of $x$ has not yet been
determined and compute a position vector for this subset. Once we have located
vertex $x$ inside $\Ht$ we have effectively determined in
which cell of the arrangement $\Ht$ $x$ lies.

We are left with hyperplanes of the set $\H \setminus \Ht$. They can be
partitioned in two disjoint sets: set $\M$ of hyperplanes that meet the cell of
$\Ht$ containing $x$ and set $\O$ for the others. The relative position of $x$ to each
hyperplane belonging to $\O$ can be deduced without the need to query the oracle, the answer
to the queries we would make can be computed by looking at the structure of
the arrangement itself. For the first group of hyperplanes we just call the
procedure again with $\H \gets \M$.

If we stop our explanation here we still have a worst case \BigO{\binom{n}{k}}
bound on the number of queries made. Hopefully, the next step of our
explanation will show that it is possible to lower this bound.
