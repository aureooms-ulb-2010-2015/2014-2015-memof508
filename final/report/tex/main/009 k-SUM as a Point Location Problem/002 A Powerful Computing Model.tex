\section{A Powerful Computing Model}

Now that we have shown how to reduce $k$-SUM to a point location in an
arrangement of hyperplanes problem, we will see that with a sufficiently
powerful computing model it is possible to solve the subset sum problem in
polynomial time.

Since the beginning of this writing, we were only interested by the number of
questions we ask to an oracle, and we will continue to take the same point of
view here. We wonder how many times we will need to effectively ask an oracle
whether a point lies above, on or under a certain hyperplane.
