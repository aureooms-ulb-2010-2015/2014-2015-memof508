\section{Reduction to a Point Location Problem}

As we have seen in \ref{tree:xy:dt}, it is possible to argument about an upper
bound on the number of possible linear extensions of the partial order of the
set $X + Y$ by reducing the problem to a point location problem in an
arrangement of hyperplanes.

We will now formally generalize this observation to the $k$-SUM problem.
