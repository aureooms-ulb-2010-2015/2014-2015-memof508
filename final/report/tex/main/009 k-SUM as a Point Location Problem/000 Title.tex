\chapter{Application of Meiser's Algorithm}

As we have seen in \ref{tree:xy:counting}, it is possible to argument about an upper
bound on the number of possible linear extensions of the poset \XY by
reducing the problem to the point location in an
arrangement of hyperplanes problem.

We will now formally generalize this observation to the \kSUM problem.
