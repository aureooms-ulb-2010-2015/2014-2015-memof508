\chapter{$k$-SUM as a Point Location Problem}

As we have seen in \ref{tree:xy:dt}, it is possible to argument about an upper
bound on the number of possible linear extensions of the poset $X + Y$ by
reducing the problem to the point location in an
arrangement of hyperplanes problem.

We will now formally generalize this observation to the $k$-SUM problem.
