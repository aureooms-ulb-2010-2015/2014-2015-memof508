\section{$(k+1)$-linear Decision Trees}

\citet*{ailon:2005} study $s$-linear decision trees to solve the \kSUM
problem when $s > k$. In particular, they give an additional proof for the
\BigOmega{n^{\ceil{\frac{k}{2}}}} lower bound of \citet{erickson:1999} and
establish new lower bounds for all $s > k$. The case $s = k+1$ leads to a
subquadratic lower bound for \threeSUM. However, at that point, we are still
missing an actual subquadratic algorithm for \threeSUM.

In the next section we will talk about the first successful attempt at finding
a subquadratic algorithm for the \threeSUM problem.
