\chapter{Decision Trees for $3$-SUM}

In this chapter, we will talk about lower bounds for $3$-SUM implied by
a reasoning on the decision tree model. We will first explain results due to
Erickson, Ailon and Chazelle about $3$-linear decision trees. Secondly we will
talk about recent results, due to Gronlund and Pettie, that refutes the $3$-SUM
conjecture using $4$-linear decision trees.
