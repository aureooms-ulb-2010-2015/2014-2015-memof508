\section{$k$-linear Decision Trees}

In \cite{erickson:1999}, it is shown that we cannot solve $3$-SUM in
subquadratic time using only the $3$-linear decision tree as a model. A
general proof for the $k$-LDT problem in the $k$-linear decision tree model
is featured. The proof is made using an adversary argument. In the case of $k$
even, a bound of \BigOmega{n^{\frac{k}{2}}} is demonstrated. For odd $k$, the
bound is \BigOmega{n^{\frac{k+1}{2}}}.

At the end of \cite{erickson:1999}, it is asked whether other forms of
decision trees would prove to be more powerful. The next section exposes a
progress in this direction made by \cite{ailon:2005}.
