\section{The Conjecture}

With the lack of an algorithm that would perform better than the na√Øve
\BigO{n^2} one, a conjecture eventually emerged,

\begin{conjecture}
The (worst-case) number of comparisons in the decision tree model for the
\threeSUM problem is \BigOmega{n^2}.
\end{conjecture}

It was indeed proved that this lower bound holds for a particular case of the
decision tree model. By restricting himself to a $3$-linear decision tree
model, \citet{erickson:1999} proves that \threeSUM is \BigOmega{n^2} in this
particular model. A second proof for this particular case is given by
\citet{ailon:2005}.

It this conjecture is true, it would mean that all the \threeSUM-hard
problems are doomed to have a \BigOmega{n^2} complexity lower bound.
