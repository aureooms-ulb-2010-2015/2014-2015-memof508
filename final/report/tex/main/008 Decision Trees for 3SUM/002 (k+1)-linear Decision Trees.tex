\section{$(k+1)$-linear Decision Trees}

\cite{ailon:2005} makes a study of $s$-linear decision trees to solve the $k$-SUM
problem when $s > k$. In particular, it gives an additional proof for the
\BigOmega{n^{\ceil{\frac{k}{2}}}} of \cite{erickson:1999} and establishes new
lower bounds for all $s > k$. The case $s = k+1$ leads to a subquadratic
lower bound for $3$-SUM. However, at that point, we are still missing an actual
subquadratic algorithm for $3$-SUM.
