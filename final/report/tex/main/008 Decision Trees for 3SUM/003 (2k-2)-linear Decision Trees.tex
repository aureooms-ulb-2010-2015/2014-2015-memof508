\section{$(2k-2)$-linear Decision Trees}

In \cite{gronlund:2014}, a new algorithm solving the $3$-SUM problem using a
subquadratic number of linear queries is shown. Moreover, two algorithms
solving the problem in subquadratic time are demonstrated.

Those results refute a long-lived conjecture stating that the $3$-SUM problem
can not be solved in subquadratic time on a \emph{Random Access Machine}.

In the classical quadratic algorithm for $3$-SUM, $3$-linear queries of the
form \emph{do these $3$ numbers sum up to $0$} are used. In their first
algorithm, breaking the \BigOmega{n^2} bound on the number of queries,
\citeauthor{gronlund:2014} use $4$-linear queries.
