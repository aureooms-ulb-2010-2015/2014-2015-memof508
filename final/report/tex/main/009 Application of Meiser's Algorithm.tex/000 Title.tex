\chapter{Application of Meiser's Algorithm}

As we have seen in \ref{tree:xy:counting}, it is possible to argue about an upper
bound on the number of possible linear extensions of the poset \XY by
reducing the problem to the point location problem in an
arrangement of hyperplanes.

We will now formally generalize this observation to the \kSUM problem.
