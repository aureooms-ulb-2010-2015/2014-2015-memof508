\chapter{Orders, Posets, Graphs and Entropy}

In the two previous chapters, we talked about orders and ordered sets without
really defining them. Now that we have some background on the subjects of
sorting and merging it is a good time to formalize the objects we are using.

That is why in this chapter we will introduce new terminology that will allow
us to identify the objects we manipulate and describe the algorithms we present
in a precise and rigorous way.
