\section{Least and Greatest Element}
\label{tree:poset:leastandgreatest}

An other term that we might want to add to our vocabulary is a term that refers
to the element $x \in P$ for which $y \geq x, \forall y \in P$. In this case,
we say that $x$ is the least element, note that not every poset has such an
element. The least element is written $\hat{0}$ and if there is a $\hat{0}$ in
$P$ we say that $P$ has a $\hat{0}$.

Similarly we define the greatest element $\hat{1}$ such that $x \leq \hat{1}$
for all $x \in P$

We define the operation of adjoining a $\hat{0}$ and $\hat{1}$ to as poset $P$,
even if $P$ already has a $\hat{0}$ or a $\hat{1}$. The resulting poset of this
operation is denoted $\hat{P}$. In \ref{fig:stanley:3-3} we see an example of
this operation applied to some poset.
