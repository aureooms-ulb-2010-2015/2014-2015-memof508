# Sorting under Partial Information

I will now explain *Sorting under Partial Information*

## Definition

We are given a finite set **big S** together with a partial order consisting of a subset
of the relations of an unknown linear order on the elements in **big S**.

We want to determine the complete linear order by making pairwise comparisons
of elements in **big S**.

The input of our problem is called a *partially ordered set* or *poset*.
The output of our problem is called a *linear extension* of the input poset.
