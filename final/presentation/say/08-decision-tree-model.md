# Decision Tree Model

## Definition

In our model,

to solve a problem we are allowed to ask questions to an oracle that are answered
``yes'' or ``no''.

Hence, each answer gives us at most
one additional bit of information.

Each question asked to the oracle costs us a single unit.

Every other operation can be carried out for free.
