# Meiser's algorithm

In the last part of this presentation, I will show how to solve *k-linear
degeneracy testing* by modeling it as a *point location problem in an
arrangement of hyperplanes*.

## Definition

Our point location problem is the following,

Given a point *x*

and a finite set of hyperplanes *H*

in the *n-dimensional Euclidean space*,

determine the relative position of *x* to the hyperplanes in *H*.
