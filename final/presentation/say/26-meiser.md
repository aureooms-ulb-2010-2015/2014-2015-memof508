To design our algorithm we will rely on the following theorem,

Given a set of hyperplanes in the *n-dimensional Euclidean space* and an
*epsilon* in the open interval **zero--one**

there exists a subset of the hyperplanes

with the following size

such that for every simplex

if the number of hyperplanes in the original set intersecting the simplex is at
least **epsilon times the size of H** then at least one of them belongs to the
subset.
