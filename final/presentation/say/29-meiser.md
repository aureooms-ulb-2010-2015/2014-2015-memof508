We explain how to build such a simplex that contains the input point

Given we have computed the relative position of the input point to a subset of
hyperplanes

we can find a first vertex of the simplex
by solving a linear optimization problem with the results of our comparisons as
constraints and choosing an arbitrary objective function

we then project the
