Like I said in the introduction,

we are interested in lower bounds and upper bounds.

The goal of each of our analyses is to show that at least a certain
number of questions are required to be asked to solve a given problem, or
to provide an algorithm solving this problem using at most a certain number of
questions.

Note that

since instances of a problem can have variable sizes

A lower bound or an upper bound is in general expressed as a function of the input size.
