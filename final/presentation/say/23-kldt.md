## Paragraph

The difference with the previous problem is that we are performing
comparisons between more than two elements.

An example of such a *"comparison"* would be **is two a minus three b plus c
less than or equal to zero**.

We consider a model where we are only allowed to query for linear combinations
of input elements.

This generic model is the *linear decision tree model*.
