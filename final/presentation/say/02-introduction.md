# Introduction


## 1st paragraph

In summary, we are interested in the number of ``yes/no'' questions needed to
solve problems.

For example,

If we can prove that at least a certain number of questions are
required in order to solve a problem, we call this result a lower bound.

If we
come up with an algorithm solving a problem using at most a certain number of
questions, we call this result an upper bound.
